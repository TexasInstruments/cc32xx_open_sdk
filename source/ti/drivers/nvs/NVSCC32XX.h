 *  Passing NVSCC32XX_CMD_SET_COPYBLOCK to NVS_control(), along with
 *  a block of memory, is used to set the copy block for an
 *  NVSCC32XX_HWAttrs structure.
 *  The copy block is a RAM buffer used as scratch when writing to non-volatile
 *  storage.
 *
 *  If the copy block is not known at compile time, for example, if it
 *  is allocated from heap memory, it can be set through NVS_control()
 *  using the command NVSCC32XX_CMD_SET_COPYBLOCK.
 *  The copy block is passed in the arg parameter of NVS_control().  The
 *  size of the copy block passed to NVS_control() must be at least
 *  as large as the flash page size, and it is up to the application to ensure
 *  this.

 *  @brief      NVSCC32XX attributes
 *
 *  For CC32XX devices, there is no need to provide the flash block
 *  address, since this is managed by the SimpleLink libraries.  The
 *  SimpleLink libraries use the notion of "files" to manage flash
 *  blocks.  We use the id field of the NVSCC32XX_HWAttrs to construct a
 *  file name that will correspond to a flash block.
 *
 *  When a file is written to, a scratch region is needed to preserve
 *  the unmodified data in the file.  This scratch region, referred to as
 *  copyBlock, should be a buffer in RAM.  The application
 *  can set copyBlock in the HWAttrs directly, if it is known at compile
 *  time, or set copyBlock through NVS_control(), for example, if it is
 *  allocated on the heap.  The copyBlock can be shared accross multiple
 *  NVS instances.  It is up to the application to ensure that copyBlock
 *  is set before the first call to NVS_write().
 *  The copyBlock should be large enough to hold the maximum file size of
 *  4 Kbytes.
 *  When writing data to a file, the contents of the file are first
 *  copied to the copyBlock.  The copyBlock is then updated with the new
 *  data, and then written back to the file.

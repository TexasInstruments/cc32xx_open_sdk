/* @brief Specification for parsing native device timestamp
 *
 * When provided with a native timestamp, however many bits, a peer device
 * may perform the calculation:
 *
 * @code
 *   double fractional = (ts & ((1 << fracBytes*8) - 1)) / 2^fracBytes*8
 *   double integral   = (ts >> fracBytes*8) & ((1 << intBytes*8) - 1)
 *   // if multiplier > 0:
 *   double time       =   abs(multiplier) * (integral + fractional) * 10^-exponent
 *   // if multiplier < 0:
 *   double time       = 1/abs(multiplier) * (integral + fractional) * 10^-exponent
 * @endcode
 *
 * For example, if the native format is a 32-bit wide fixed point fractional
 * value with 16 bits for seconds and subseconds, the setting would be:
 * fracBytes = 2, intBytes = 2, multiplier = 1, exponent = 0
 *
 * On the other hand if the native format is a 32-bit wide integral value
 * where each tick is worth 8 microseconds, you get this:
 * fracBytes = 0, intBytes = 4, multiplier = 8, exponent = 6
 *
 * If the native format is a 48-bit wide 32786 Hz counter where each
 * tick is worth 30.5175 etc us, the setting would be:
 * fracBytes = 0, intBytes = 6, multiplier = -32768, exponent = 0
 *
 * It is expected that if there is a fractional part, it is in the LSB end.

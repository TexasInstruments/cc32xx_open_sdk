This function will be called repeatedly while no tasks are
ready to run.

Ordinarily (in applications that have tasks ready to run at startup),
the function will run in the context of the last task to block.

In an application where there are no tasks ready to run
when BIOS_start() is called, the allBlockedFunc function is
called within the BIOS_start() thread which runs on the system/ISR
stack.

By default, allBlockedFunc is initialized to point to an internal
function that simply returns.

By adding the following lines to the config script, the Idle
functions will run whenever all tasks are blocked:

~~~
Task.enableIdleTask = false;
Task.allBlockedFunc = "Idle_run";
~~~

                description: `Initialize stack with known value for stack checking at runtime (see checkStackFlag).`,
                longDescription: `
If this flag is set to false, while the ti.sysbios.hal.Hwi#checkStackFlag is set to true,
only the first byte of the stack is initialized.

This is also useful for inspection of stack in debugger or core dump utilities. Default is true.
                `,

                context switch.`,
                longDescription: `
The check consists of testing the top of stack value against its initial
value (see initStackFlag). If it is no longer at this value, the assumption
is that the task has overrun its stack. If the test fails, then the
E_stackOverflow error is raised.

Default is true.

To enable or disable full stack checking, you should set both this flag and
the ti.sysbios.hal.Hwi#checkStackFlag.

***note:*** Enabling stack checking will add some interrupt latency because
the checks are made within the Task scheduler while interrupts are disabled.

When set to true, a task is constructed that continuously calls the
Idle_run() function, which, in turn calls each of
the configured Idle functions.

When set to false, no Idle Task is created and it is up to the
user to call the Idle_run() function if the configured Idle
functions need to be run. Or, by adding the following lines to
the config script, the Idle functions will run whenever all
tasks are blocked:
~~~
Task.enableIdleTask = false;
Task.allBlockedFunc = "Idle_run";

                longDescription: `
By default, interrupts are disabled within certain critical
sections of the task scheduler when switching to a different
task thread. This default behavior guarantees that a task stack
will only ever absorb ONE ISR context. Nested interrupts all run
on the shared Hwi stack.

While most users find this behavior desirable, the resulting
impact on interrupt latency is too great for certain applications.

By setting this parameter to 'true', the worst case interrupt latency
imposed by the kernel will be reduced but will result in task stacks
needing to be sized to accommodate one additional interrupt context.

If this feature is enabled, an Idle function is installed that deletes
dynamically created Tasks that have terminated either by falling through
their task function or by explicitly calling Task_exit().

A list of terminated Tasks that were created dynmically is maintained
internally. Each invocation of the installed Idle function deletes the first
Task on this list. This one-at-a-time process continues until the list is
empty.

***note:*** This feature is disabled by default.

***warning:*** When this feature is enabled, an error will be raised if the
user's application attempts to delete a terminated task. If a terminated task
has already been automatically deleted and THEN the user's application
attempts to delete it (ie: using a stale Task handle), the results are
undefined and probably catastrophic!

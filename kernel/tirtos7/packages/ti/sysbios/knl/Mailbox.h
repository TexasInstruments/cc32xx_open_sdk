 * @brief Mailbox Manager
 *
 * The Mailbox module makes available a set of functions that manipulate mailbox
 * objects accessed through handles of type Mailbox_Handle.
 *
 * @link Mailbox_pend @endlink is used to wait for a message from a mailbox.
 * The timeout parameter to Mailbox_pend allows the task to wait until a timeout
 * specified in terms of system clock ticks. A timeout value of @link
 * BIOS_WAIT_FOREVER @endlink causes the task to wait
 * indefinitely for a message. A timeout value of @link BIOS_NO_WAIT @endlink
 * causes Mailbox_pend to return immediately. Mailbox_pend's
 * return value indicates whether the mailbox was signaled successfully.
 *
 * When a Mailbox has been configured with a readerEvent
 * Event object and a task has returned from @link Event_pend @endlink with
 * the corresponding readerEventId, then BIOS_NO_WAIT
 * should be passed to Mailbox_pend() to retrieve the message.
 *
 * NOTE: Since only a single reader can pend on a readerEvent
 * Event object, a Mailbox configured with a readerEvent
 * Event object does not support multiple readers.
 *
 * @link Mailbox_post @endlink is used to send a message to a mailbox. The
 * timeout parameter to Mailbox_post specifies the amount of time the calling
 * task waits if the mailbox is full.
 *
 * When a Mailbox has been configured with a writerEvent
 * Event object and a task has returned from @link Event_pend @endlink with
 * the corresponding writerEventId, then BIOS_NO_WAIT
 * should be passed to Mailbox_post() knowing that the message will be
 * successfully posted.
 *
 * To use the Mailbox module,
 * the following must be added to the app.syscfg file:
 *
 * @code 
 * const Mailbox = scripting.addModule("/ti/sysbios/knl/Mailbox");
 * @endcode 
 *
 * NOTE: Since only a single writer can pend on a writerEvent
 * Event object, a Mailbox configured with a writerEvent
 * Event object does not support multiple writers.

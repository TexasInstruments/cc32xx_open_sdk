This string specifies the set of optional argument conversion specifiers
required by the application.  By reducing the number of optional conversions
understood by the System printf methods, it is possible to significantly
reduce the code size footprint of the System module.  This configuration
parameter enables one to balance printf functionality against code size
footprint.

The format of this string is simply a concatenated list of the desired
conversion specifiers (with the leading % character).  For example, to
support %f, set extendedFormats to "%f".

To disable all optional converstions, set extendedFormats to null or
the empty string "".

For a complete list of supported extensions, see the System_printf
"Extended_Format_Specifiers" section.

***Note:*** If an optional conversion is used by some part of the application
and it is not specified in extendedFormats, the conversion character(s)
and leading % are treated as ordinary characters to be output.  As a
result, all subsequent arguments will almost certainly be converted using the
wrong conversion specifier!

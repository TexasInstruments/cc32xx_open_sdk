 * @file ti/sysbios/runtime/Assert.h
 * @brief Runtime assertion manager
 *
 * The `Assert` module provides configurable diagnostics to the program. Similar
 * to the standard C `assert()` macro, `Assert` methods are interspersed with
 * other code to add diagnostics to a program. Unlike the standard C assert
 * support, the `Assert` module provides greater flexibility in managing the
 * messages displayed, the message string space overhead, and the runtime
 * handling of failures. In addition, because the `Assert` methods build atop
 * the Diags module, you can precisely control which asserts remain in the final
 * application, if any.
 *
 * `Assert` statements are added to the code using the Assert_isTrue macro.
 *
 * The following C code adds an assert to application code
 *
 * @code
 *  #define BIOS_assertsEnabled_D 1
 *  #include <ti/sysbios/runtime/Assert.h>
 *
 *  Assert_isTrue(count > 0, NULL);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Assert calls can also be completely removed by defining the symbol
 * BIOS_assertsEnabled_D to 0. This can be done on the compile line, e.g.
 * -DBIOS_assertsEnabled_D=0. This will completely remove the Assert
 * statements from any code compiled with this flag, regardless of the
 * application's configuration or your compiler's optimization settings.

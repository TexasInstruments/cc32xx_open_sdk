                entrant`,
                longDescription: `
The application gets to determine the type of gate (lock) that is used in the TI RTS library. The gate will be used to
guarantee re-entrancy of the RTS APIs.

The type of gate depends on the type of threads that are going to be calling into the RTS library.  For example, if
both Swi and Task threads are going to be calling the RTS library's printf, GateSwi should be used. In this case, Hwi
threads are not impacted (i.e. disabled) during the printf calls from the Swi or Task threads.

If NoLocking is used, the RTS lock is not plugged and re-entrancy for the TI RTS library calls are not guaranteed. The
application can plug the RTS locks directly if it wants.

Numerous gate types are provided by SYS/BIOS.  Each has its advantages and disadvantages.  The following list
summarizes when each type is appropriate for protecting an underlying non-reentrant RTS library.

- GateHwi: Interrupts are disabled and restored to maintain re-entrancy. Use if only making RTS calls from a Hwi, Swi
  and/or Task.

- GateSwi: Swis are disabled and restored to maintain re-entrancy. Use if only making RTS calls from a Swi and/or
  Task.

- GateMutex: A single mutex is used to maintain re-entrancy.  Use if only making RTS calls from a Task.  Blocks only
  Tasks that are also trying to execute critical regions of RTS library.

- GateMutexPri: A priority inheriting mutex is used to maintain re-entrancy. Blocks only Tasks that are also trying to
  execute critical regions of RTS library.  Raises the priority of the Task that is executing the critical region in
  the RTS library to the level of the highest priority Task that is block by the mutex.

The default value of rtsGateType depends on the type of threading model enabled by other configuration parameters. If
taskEnabled is true, GateMutex is used. If swiEnabled is true and taskEnabled is false: GateSwi is used. If both
swiEnabled and taskEnabled are false: xdc.runtime#GateNull is used.

If taskEnabled is false, the user should not select GateMutex (or other Task level gates). Similarly, if taskEnabled
and swiEnabledare false, the user should not select GateSwi or the Task level gates.`,

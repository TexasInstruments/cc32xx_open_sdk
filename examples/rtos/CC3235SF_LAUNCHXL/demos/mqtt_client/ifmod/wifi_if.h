//*****************************************************************************
/* This module enables an easy integration of Wi-Fi to a SimpleLink Networking
 * framework.
 * It was designed for applications that use the Wi-Fi Station role only.
 * The simple API and settings enables the user to initiate the Wi-Fi and
 * configure the provisioning method that will be used upon first connection
 * attempt.
 * Upon successful init (WIFI_IF_init()), the system enables the NWP for any
 * SL commands.
 * The NWP will be in a low power state (AUTO-CONNECT will be disabled) waiting
 * for connection request (SlNetConn_Start()).
 * User should not call sl_Start/sl_Stop when using this module. Please use
 * WIFI_IF_restart() (for reseting the NWP) or WIFI_IF_deinit() instead.

    \brief Allocate resources and initialize Wi-Fi, including Simpleink driver
           (SL Spawn) and SlWifiConn (WiFi Connection and provisioning thread).
           This sets the Wi-Fi in Station role, ready to connect with the SlNetConn
           API.
           According to the user settings above, a provisioning method may be enabled or
           static network configuration will be set.

    \param[in] none

    \return                 0 upon success or a negative error code

    \note  Should be called before any access to Wi-Fi (through SlNetConn).
           sl_Start will be called in this context and should not be used elsewhere
           (If NWP reset is needed, please use WIFI_IF_reset()).
           The device will stay in a low-power (idle) mode until an connection
           (to an Access Point) will be requested using the SlNetConn_Start() API.
           Any SL command can be used after a successful completion as the NWP is enabled.
           It is recommended to use this only once when the application starts and control
           the Wi-Fi connection through the SlNetConn_Start(), SlNetConn_Stop().

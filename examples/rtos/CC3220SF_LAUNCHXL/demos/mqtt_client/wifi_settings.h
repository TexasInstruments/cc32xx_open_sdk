//                 WIFI IF INTRODUCTION
//*****************************************************************************
/* This module enables an easy integration of Wi-Fi to a SimpleLink Networking
 * framework.
 * It was designed for applications that use the Wi-Fi Station role only.
 * The simple API and settings enables the user to initiate the Wi-Fi and
 * configure the provisioning method that will be used upon first connection
 * attempt.
 * Upon successful init (WIFI_IF_init()), the system enables the NWP for any
 * SL commands.
 * The NWP will be in a low power state (AUTO-CONNECT will be disabled) waiting
 * for connection request (SlNetConn_Start()).
 * User should not call sl_Start/sl_Stop when using this module. Please use
 * WIFI_IF_restart() (for reseting the NWP) or WIFI_IF_deinit() instead.
